# CI/CD and Dockerization Implementation Plan (Homelab Deployment)

This document outlines the implementation plan for introducing CI/CD with GitHub Actions and Dockerization for the MyFoodBudget Flask application, specifically tailored for homelab deployment.

## Overview

The plan focuses on containerizing the Flask application with Docker and implementing automated CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions, with deployment targeting a homelab server environment.

## 1. Docker Containerization Strategy

### Multi-stage Dockerfile Structure
- **Base stage**: Python 3.11-slim with system dependencies
- **Dependencies stage**: Install Python packages using requirements.txt
- **Production stage**: Copy application code and set up non-root user
- **Health checks**: Implement endpoint monitoring
- **Volume management**: Persistent SQLite database storage

### Docker Compose Setup
- **Development environment**: Hot-reload with volume mounts for active development
- **Production environment**: Optimized container with health checks and resource limits
- **Database persistence**: Docker volumes for SQLite file and session storage

### Key Docker Features
- Multi-stage builds for optimized image size
- Non-root user for security
- Health check endpoints
- Proper signal handling for graceful shutdowns

## 2. GitHub Actions CI/CD Workflows

### CI Pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
**Triggers**: Pull requests and pushes to main branch

**Testing Matrix**: Python versions (3.9, 3.10, 3.11)

**Pipeline Steps**:
1. **Code Quality**: Linting and formatting checks
2. **Testing**: Unit tests with coverage reporting
3. **Security**: Security vulnerability scanning
4. **Build**: Docker image build and validation
5. **Quality Gates**: Coverage thresholds and code quality metrics

### CD Pipeline (`.github/workflows/cd.yml`)
**Triggers**: Successful CI completion on main branch

**Deployment Process**:
1. **Container Registry**: Push to GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io)
2. **Homelab Deployment**: SSH-based deployment to laptop server
3. **Service Management**: Stop old container → Pull new image → Start new container
4. **Health Verification**: Post-deployment health checks
5. **Rollback Capability**: Maintain previous image tags for quick rollback

## 3. Configuration Management

### Environment-Specific Configuration Classes

#### TestingConfig
- In-memory SQLite database
- Reduced session timeouts
- Debug logging enabled
- Test-specific feature flags

#### ProductionConfig
- File-based SQLite with proper paths
- Environment variable configuration
- Secure session management
- Production logging levels

### Security Enhancements
- **Secrets Management**: GitHub secrets for sensitive configuration
- **Environment Variables**: Database URLs, secret keys, API tokens
- **Configuration Validation**: Startup checks for required variables
- **Security Headers**: Enhanced Flask security middleware

### Environment Variable Structure
```bash
# Production Environment Variables
FLASK_ENV=production
SECRET_KEY=<secure-random-key>
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///data/myfoodbudget.db
SESSION_LIFETIME_MINUTES=60
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

## 4. Testing Infrastructure Enhancement

- **flake8**: Linting
- **safety**: Security vulnerability checking

### Testing Improvements
- **Coverage Reporting**: Integrated with CI pipeline
- **Integration Tests**: API endpoint testing
- **Test Parallelization**: Faster test execution
- **Test Data Management**: Improved fixtures and test isolation

### Test Execution Strategy
```bash
# Local testing
pytest tests/ --cov=. --cov-report=html

# CI testing with parallel execution
pytest tests/ --cov=. --cov-report=xml -n auto
```

## 5. Homelab Deployment Strategy

### Server Setup Requirements

#### Infrastructure Prerequisites
- **Docker Engine**: Latest stable version installed
- **Docker Compose**: For multi-container orchestration
- **Reverse Proxy**: Nginx or Traefik for SSL termination and routing
- **Networking**: Port forwarding and firewall configuration

```

### Deployment Automation

#### SSH-Based Deployment Process
1. **Pre-deployment**: Health check and backup creation
2. **Image Pull**: Download latest container image
3. **Service Update**: Graceful container replacement
4. **Post-deployment**: Health verification and cleanup
5. **Rollback**: Automated rollback on failure

#### Deployment Script (`deploy/homelab-deploy.sh`)
- Container lifecycle management
- Database migration handling
- Log rotation and cleanup
- Health check verification
- Rollback procedures

### Data Management
- **Persistence**: Docker volumes for database and sessions
